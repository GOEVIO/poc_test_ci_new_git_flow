# evio-redis-connection

A library to provide methods to interact with a Redis instance and sentinels, built on top of [ioredis](https://github.com/redis/ioredis).

## Features

- Connects to Redis using sentinels for high availability
- Supports named connections to help identify which services are connected
- Methods for reading and writing data, with and without TTL (expiration)
- Timeout settings for sent commands and operations
- Ensures a valid connection before performing any operation

## Installation

Clone this repository and run:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

## Usage

Import and use the connection:

```typescript
import { createRedisConnection } from 'evio-redis-connection';

const redis = createRedisConnection({
  name: 'my-service',
  sentinels: [
    /* ... */
  ],
  // other options
});

// Set a value
await redis.set('key', 'value');

// Get a value
const value = await redis.get('key');
```

## Scripts

- `npm run build` - Compile TypeScript to JavaScript
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm run format` - Format code with Prettier
- `npm run test:watch` - Run tests in watch mode
- `npm run test:pipeline` - Run tests once
